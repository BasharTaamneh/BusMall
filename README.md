# BusMall

- BusMall does market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest… before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

- To make this market analysis maximally effective, BusMall an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side by side by side) 

- The app’s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

 - To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, BusMall does not allow any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

-  keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.
